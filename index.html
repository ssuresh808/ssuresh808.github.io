          Hi sweetheart, I really wanted to ask you to be my Valentine. Honestly, the day you me over I had some
          stuff planned out and sadly it didn't go through. I really wanted to make it special for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know you are in India and these last couple weeks have been difficult for us both. Not a single day has
          gone by where I haven't thought about you and us. I have been working on this for a little while now and I
          wanted to make it all nice for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am so happy and proud of the relationship we have together, and if you clicked “Yes” and saw this
          message I hope that a smile came across your face. You are the most important person in my life and I want
          you to know that I love you so damn much. I can't wait to hold you in my arms and spend every second I can
          with you. I am so excited for you to come back to me. I will be waiting patiently till then.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love you so much. Thank you for being my Valentine.
        </p>
